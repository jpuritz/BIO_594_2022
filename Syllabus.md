## Course Description
The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has rapidly transcended population genetics to population genomics. Sequencer outputs have expanded from kilobases to gigabases while becoming over 30,000 times less expensive. This allows population levels studies to use thousands of genetic markers across the entire genome, and to survey both neutral and adaptive loci. In this class, we will cover a variety of techniques including: restriction-site associated sequencing (RADseq), RNA sequencing and transcriptomics, exome capture, low-coverage whole genome sequencing, pooled sequencing, and methods designed to examine patterns of methylation across genomes.

Techniques will be focused on non-model organisms without reference genomes. Lectures will be focused on experimental design, technical limitations, and analytical objectives. Computer-based “laboratory sessions” will immediately follow the lecture and cover bioinformatics, especially initial data assessment and manipulation, and population genomic analyses using real and simulated data sets. Students are encouraged to bring their own data sets to the class, and the final curriculum will be tailored to class interests.

## Course Goals and Student Learning Outcomes
After completing this course, students should be able to:
* Effectively work in a command-line Linux environment
* Visualize and manipulate multiple next-generation sequencing data formats
* Use and apply the tools and analyses covered in class
* Knowledgeably filter data sets for statistical and bioinformatic artifacts
* Determine loci potentially under selection and estimate population genetic parameters with both neutral and putatively adaptive loci
* Produce a completely open and repeatable documentation of a complete population genomic analysis utilizing RMarkDown within RStudio Server.

## Readings
Readings will be selected from web based tutorials, package vignettes, software documentation, and the primary literature.  Readings will be assigned on a week by week basis.  

## Required Equipment
Students must bring their own laptop (Mac, Windows, or Linux) with the capability of SSHing into a linux server.  Please contact the instructor if you do not have a laptop available to use and/or requiring one is not a financial possibility.
We will be doing the majority of our code documentation in RStudio. Please familiarize yourself with by downloading a local installation.  We will be using a server based version to unify our bioinformatics and analysis.

## Course Assistance
This is a challenging course. Success requires that you keep pace with the work, understand course concepts, and study effectively. The Academic Enhancement Center (AEC) and Writing Center (WC), located in Roosevelt Hall, offers several kinds of support that help students improve their learning and academic performance in this and other classes. For information on any of these programs, visit [uri.edu/aec](uri.edu/aec), call the AEC’s main number at (401) 874-2367, or follow the specific suggestions below

* ***Subject Specific Tutoring***, located on the fourth floor of Roosevelt Hall, helps students navigate 100 and 200 level math, chemistry, physics, biology, and other select STEM courses. Options for peer tutoring are designed to enable you to get the kind of help you need when you need it. Students can join a **Weekly Tutoring Group** with others in their courses (information on groups will be made available to you in supported classes), stop by a subject-specific Drop-In Center as needed, or make a one-time **Group Appointment**. Information on what these programs offer, when they are available, and how to utilize them is available at [uri.edu/aec/tutoring](uri.edu/aec/tutoring).

* ***Academic Skills and Strategies*** programs help students identify their individual planning and studying needs in this or any other course. They can teach you more effective ways of studying, planning, managing time and work, and how to deal with challenges like procrastination and motivation. **Academic Skills Sessions** are 30-minute, one-on-one appointments that students can schedule online by visiting the AEC on Starfish and making an appointment with Dr. David Hayes, the AEC’s academic skills development specialist. **UCS160: Success in Higher Education** is a one-credit course offered each semester to all undergraduates on learning how to learn and excel in college academics. For more information on these programs or for help making an appointment, visit [uri.edu/aec/academic-skills](uri.edu/aec/academic-skills) or contact Dr. Hayes directly at davidhayes@uri.edu

## Conduct and Behavior
Students are expected to treat faculty and fellow classmates with dignity and respect.  Students are responsible for being familiar with and adhering to the published "Student Code of Conduct" which can be accessed in the University Student Handbook [http://web.uri.edu/studentconduct/student-handbook/](http://web.uri.edu/studentconduct/student-handbook/).  If you must come in late, please do not disrupt the class.  Please turn off all cell phones, e-watches, or any electronic devices.

## Academic Honesty
Students are expected to be honest in all academic work. A student’s name on any written work, quiz or exam shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result of the student’s own independent thought and study. Work should be stated in the student’s own words, properly attributed to its source.   Students have an obligation to know how to quote, paraphrase, summarize, cite and reference the work of others with integrity. The following are examples of academic dishonesty.

* Using material, directly or paraphrasing, from published sources (print or electronic) without appropriate citation

* Claiming disproportionate credit for work not done independently

* Unauthorized possession or access to exams

* Unauthorized communication during exams

* Unauthorized use of another’s work or preparing work for another student

* Taking an exam for another student

* Altering or attempting to alter grades

* The use of notes or electronic devices to gain an unauthorized advantage during exams

* Fabricating or falsifying facts, data or references

* Facilitating or aiding another’s academic dishonesty

* Submitting the same paper for more than one course without prior approval from the instructors.
