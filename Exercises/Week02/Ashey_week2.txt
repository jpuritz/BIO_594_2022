Exercise 2 - Answer these challenges with one line of code

I have put a text file, named file, in the directory sneaky that’s within the directory Exercises that’s within the directory BIO594 in the home directory. Tell me what the contents of the file are.

```
cd /home/BIO594/Exercises/sneaky
cat file 
Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?

                                       Answer.
That you are here—that life exists and identity,
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.

Print how many individuals have a MEAN_DEPTH greater than 20.1

```
awk '$3 > 20' out.idepth
