# Analyzing Pumpkin's DNA
## WGS Data Analysis Pipeline
![Pumpkin](https://github.com/jpuritz/BIO_594_2022/tree/main/Exercises/course_project/mgregoire/pumpkin_resize.jpg)
Pumpkin got his DNA sequenced through Basepaws! He got a mouth swab and sent it in for sequencing and analysis. Below is a pipeline I have established for some analyses that can be performed on the resulting fastq and vcf files generated by Basepaws.

## Set up directories, softwares, and files 
Make sure that bioconda is is installed. I am using the Kitt server and bioconda has already been installed. Bioconda makes it easy to install many of the various programs that will be used in this pipeline (eg: fastqc).
Make a folder for the project and cd into it. 
- `mkdir FinalProject | cd FinalProject`

Since the files were supplied to me on a flashdrive from Basepaws, I sftp'd the files onto the kitt server with the following commands:
- `sftp -P {port number here} {username}@kitt.uri.edu`
- `cd FinalProject`
- `lcd D: | lls`
- `put AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.LP.713.F3.L2.R163.WGS.fastq.gz | put AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.SP.299.B2.L2.R160.WGS.fastq.gz | put AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.SP.307.D1.L1.R170.WGS.fastq.gz | put pumpkin_102.hard-filtered.gvcf | put pumpkin_102.hard-filtered.gvcf.gz.tbi`

I wish I knew what the information in these file names mean! Since I don't know, we'll go ahead and analyze all 3 files.

Unzip the files
- `gunzip AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.LP.713.F3.L2.R163.WGS.fastq.gz`
- `gunzip AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.SP.299.B2.L2.R160.WGS.fastq.gz`
- `gunzip AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.SP.307.D1.L1.R170.WGS.fastq.gz`

## Run fastqc on the files to check for quality
Run fastqc and download the .html output files
- `fastqc *.fastq`
- `sftp -P {port number here} {username}@kitt.uri.edu`
- `cd FinalProject`
- `lcd Documents\Pumpkin`
-  `get AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.LP.713.F3.L2.R163.WGS_fastqc.html | get AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.SP.299.B2.L2.R160.WGS_fastqc.html | get AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.SP.307.D1.L1.R170.WGS_fastqc.html`

The fastqc files from Pumpkin's DNA reveal the following:
- **Per base sequence quality**: The quality scores across all bases look good for all 3 fastq files! The reads start to drop off towards the tail ends (this is expected as the reads get longer), but the scores stay in the green zone the entire time hovering around 36-34 and only with error bars dropping to about 25 from 100-150bp. This means that the average of the reads had >99.9% accuracy.
- **Per sequence quality scores**: The quality score distribution across all sequences peak at 36 for all three files. This means that Q36 had more read numbers than other quality scores.
- **Per base sequence content**: This metric shows that the percentage of each of the four nucleotides (A, T, C, G) at each position across all reads showed normal random distributions without bias for all three files. There is some bias seen in the beginning from bases 1-10, though this could be due to adaptors.
- **Per sequence GC content**: The per sequence GC content for all three files demonstrated that the sequences have a normal distrubution of overall GC content signifying that the samples are likely not contaminated.
- **Per base N content**: This paramater shows that there was a low call of Ns (or unknown bases) in the sequences for all three files.
- **Sequence Length Distribution**: This parameter was flagged for all three files with an "!" meaning that it is not ideal but not detrimental. This metric looks at the size of the sequence fragments. Some sequencers keep this relatively uniform with a normal distribution, whereas others can output reads of varying lengths showing increasing distribution on the graphs.
- **Sequence Duplication Levels**: The sequence duplication levels were flagged with "!" for two of the files "AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.SP.307.D1.L1.R170.WGS.fastq" and "AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.SP.299.B2.L2.R160.WGS.fastq." This parameter counts the degree of duplication for every sequence in the library and creates a plot showing the relative number of sequences with different degrees of duplication. For these files the percent duplication shows that about 15% of the reads were duplicated around 10 times. This is okay, it is a low level of duplication that may indicate a very high level of coverage of the target sequence. If this number was high (above 20% for a large number of reads) it could signify enrichment bias (like PCR duplication).
- **Overrepresented sequences**: There were no overrepresented sequences for any of the files.
- **Adapter Content**: The adapter content for all three files indicated low to no adaptor content. 

## Trim reads with FastP 
Fastp will automatically trim adaptor content, which is not really necessary since Pumpkin's files all show low to no adaptor content from the fastqc. Fastp will also trim out reads with high N content. We will also use flags to trim the first 10 base pairs off the reads because these showed some bias in the per base sequence content (however low), and we will filter anything with an average quality score of 28 out and anything that is less than 20bp in length.
- `fastp -i AA.WQ.58.31210251600500.LP.713.F3.L2.R163.WGS.fastq -o R163.fq -f 10 --qualified_quality_phred 28 --length_required 20`

## Check quality again with fastqc after trimming 
Run fastqc as follows and download the output .html files with sftp.
- `sftp -P {port number here} {username}@kitt.uri.edu`
- `cd FinalProject`
- `lcd Documents\Pumpkin`
- `fastqc R163.fq` `get R163_fastqc.html`--> The trimming cleaned up the per base sequence quality and per base sequence content.
- `fastqc R160.fq` `get R160_fastqc.html`--> The trimming cleaned up the per base sequence quality and per base sequence content.
- `fastqc R170.fq` `get R170_fastqc.html`--> The trimming cleaned up the per base sequence quality and per base sequence content.

## Align Pumpkinâ€™s DNA to the domestic cat reference genome Felis catus 9.0 using the Burrows Wheeler Aligner and the default parameters 
Download the reference genome.
Go to: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000181335.5 and download the reference fasta assembly. Upload this to the server with sftp.
- `sftp -P {port number here} {username}@kitt.uri.edu`
- `cd FinalProject`
- `lcd Downloads`
- `put felis_catus9.0.tar`
- `tar -xvf felis_catus9.0.tar`
- `cd ncbi-genomes-2022-04-21`
- `gunzip GCA_000181335.5_Felis_catus_9.0_genomic.fna`

Then make an index of the reference genome
- `bwa index -a bwtsw GCA_000181335.5_Felis_catus_9.0_genomic.fna FelisCatus`

Align the reads
- `bwa mem GCA_000181335.5_Felis_catus_9.0_genomic.fna ../R163.fq > aln-R163.sam`
- `bwa mem GCA_000181335.5_Felis_catus_9.0_genomic.fna ../R160.fq > aln-R160.sam`
- `bwa mem GCA_000181335.5_Felis_catus_9.0_genomic.fna ../R170.fq > aln-R170.sam`

This took a really long time, I'm not sure if the commands actually finished running for R160 or R170, I needed to go off WiFi while running both and so the terminal got halted. I will go with what was aligned just for the sake of time! --I could increase the threads to make these commands run faster but since the files are very large, I will not bother with it --we still have one file to work with!

## Manipulating the files with Samtools and removing duplicate reads
For further analysis, the SAM files from the alignments must be converted to BAM files. 
- `samtools view -S -b aln-R163.sam > aln-R163.bam`
- `samtools view -S -b aln-R160.sam > aln-R160.bam` --> Parse error at line ___  error reading file "aln-R160.sam": No such file or directory --must be due to the alignment not completing
- `samtools view -S -b aln-R170.sam > aln-R170.bam` --> Parse error at line ___ error reading file "aln-R170.sam": No such file or directory --must be due to the alignment not completing

Since the parse errors have occured in the files that did not finish aligning to the reference genome, we will just continue analyzing the one file that did finish (R163).

The alignments produced are in random order with respect to their position in the reference genome. We want to be able to call for variants so we must manipulate these BAM files so that the alignments occur in an order positionally based upon their alignment coordinates on each chromosome.
- `samtools sort aln-R163.bam -o aln-R163.sorted.bam`

Now we can index the genome sorted BAM files to allows us to extract alignments overlapping particular genomic regions. This allows us to quickly display alignments in each genomic region and is required by some genome viewers.
- `samtools index aln-R163.sorted.bam`

When we checked the quality of the reads with Fastqc we saw that the sequence duplication levels were low for the files (and were not even flagged for file R163), so we will not filter for any duplicates (which could be done with Samblaster). 

## SNPs and small indels can be investigated with Samtools 1.2, Platypus, or FreeBayes, filtering out anything with a low quality of less than 20
Next I will use FreeBays, a Bayesian genetic variant detector, to find small polymorphisms (such as SNPs and indels) in Pumpkin's DNA. This program will use the cat reference genome and the sorted bam file and output a variant call format (vcf) file.

- `freebayes -f GCA_000181335.5_Felis_catus_9.0_genomic.fna aln-R163.sorted.bam > aln-R163var.vcf`

## SnpEff can then be used to detect variant effects. 
The vcf or variant call format files list all the differences between Pumpkin's DNA and the reference genome. To learn more about these variants other than their genetic coordinates (such as if they are in a gene, an exon, cause a protein coding change) we need to annotate the vcf file. SnpEff is a program that can do this for us.

- `conda install -c bioconda snpeff`
- `snpEff Felis_catus_9.0.99 aln-R163var.vcf > EFF.R163.vcf`

## Visualize VCF data with vcfR
We will use vcfR to visualize the vcf files of Pumpkin's SNPs. VcfR is an R package intended to help visualize, manipulate, and quality filter data in VCF files.

```
library(vcfR)
my_vcf <- read.vcfR( vcf_file, verbose = FALSE )
BP_vcf <- read.vcfR( vcf_file, verbose = FALSE )

my_chrom <- create.chromR(name='pickchromo', vcf=my_vcf)
BP_chrom <- create.chromR(name='pickchromo', vcf=BP_vcf)
head(my_chrom)
head(BP_chrom)

plot(my_chrom)
plot(BP_chrom)

my_chrom <- masker(my_chrom, min_QUAL = , min_DP = , max_DP = , min_MQ = ,  max_MQ = )
plot(my_chrom)
BP_chrom <- masker(BP_chrom, min_QUAL = , min_DP = , max_DP = , min_MQ = ,  max_MQ = )
plot(BP_chrom)

my_chrom <- proc.chromR(my_chrom, verbose=TRUE)
BP_chrom <- proc.chromR(BP_chrom, verbose=TRUE)
plot(my_chrom)
plot(BP_chrom)

chromoqc(my_chrom, dp.alpha=20)
chromoqc(BP_chrom, dp.alpha=20)

dp <- extract.gt(chrom, element="DP", as.numeric=TRUE)
rownames(dp) <- 1:nrow(dp)
head(dp)
heatmap.bp(dp[1001:1500,])
is.na(dp[na.omit(dp == 0)]) <- TRUE
heatmap.bp(dp[1001:1500,])



prep.data <- radiator::tidy_vcf(data = "populations.snps.vcf")
```

## Compare with the conclusions sent in Pumpkin's report!
Pumpkin's report from Basepaws was broken down into three main parts: a breed profile, a dental report, and his genetic report.

His breed profile indicated that he is mostly a western breed cat (68.82%). A large portion of his genome (17.7%) was found to be similar to Maine Coon cats (which explains why he's SO big!), Norwegian forest cats (7.88%), he also shares some DNA with Abyssinian cats (5.01%), persian cats (9.59%), and British shorthair (8%) among many others. Based on this Basepaws assumes that his blood type is likely type A based on his European and American descent.

The report also included a dental report which scored Pumpkin's risk of periodontal disease as low, his risk of tooth resporption as low, and his risk of bad breath as medium (which I actually can attest to being stinky!). This was assessed by looking at the sequences of bacterial DNA obtained from Pumpkin's spit on the swab. Out of 182 microbes that were detected, 44 are associated with bad breath! (Diaphorobacter sp., Acidovorax sp., and Pseudomonas denitirificans are Pumpkin's top three high risk microbes for bad breath.)

From his genetic report, he was found to be a carrier of one trait marker (dilute coat color, del(T) in gene MLPH), he was cleared of 31 genetic markers for disease, but was found to be at risk for one genetic marker involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), where in the gene MYBPC3 he has one copy of a C>G mutation. HCM is the most common feline heart disease and is characterized by thickening of the heart's muscular walls and tachycardia (fast heart beat). The severity of the disease varies and if it is diagnosed early treatment is easier. It is good to know this and inform Pumpkin's vet that he is a carrier for this condition! 

At the end of the report they characterized what Pumpkin is eating based on random DNA they found, and they said they found duck DNA. Pumpkin is mainly a seafood guy and he's only an indoor cat, so we think this is probably due to a filler in his dry food!

My analysis of Pumpkin's DNA showed..... --issues with not knowing what the file names meant, issues with the size of the files/speed of analysis...

I never knew that the analysis behind all of Pumpkin's DNA would take so much work. I spent a couple weeks analyzing his DNA for this project and did not get anywhere near the extent of analysis that Basepaws did. It is truly amazing what can be done with the right equipment and when you have an established pipeline and know what to look for. Kudos to all the wonderful people at Basepaws who made both analyzing Pumpkin's DNA for this project possible, and also knowing all about his health :)
