- For this final project I decided to analyze my cat Pumpkin's DNA. 
- pipeline.md shows all the relevant code with comments on the analysis.
- Also attached are:
- an outline proposing this project
- the fastqc files pre and post trimming 
- a jupyter notebook file from the python analysis
- images and graphs from the analysis in R and python
- as well as a photo of Pumpkin :)
